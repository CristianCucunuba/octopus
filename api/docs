POST /publications/:id (on creation, we will also create state to draft)

PATCH /publications/:id (will return error if not draft) - content

PUT /publications/:id/status (will return error if no permission, or is LIVE to DRAFT, likewise if no permission to hide)

DELETE /links/:id (let's have a think)

POST /links
{
    from:
    to: 
}

Tests:

Can someone make a link?
Can someone make live?
